# MyWebsiteBackend

## Introduction

As you may have guessed already, this is the backend part of my personal website. 
This is a work in progress. This project exists so that I can practise my skills in C#. 
I don't have a frontend yet, but I plan to create one with React, so that I can practise my React skills too :D.

I add as many things as I can possibly add while it still makes sense for a personal website. If you have any suggestions, please, let me know. 

Have a look on the code and come back after some time to see it come to life :)
